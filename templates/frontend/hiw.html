<p>
    Shiftor is a social platform that connects Venue Managers and Staff Candidates within the Bar/Restaurant Industry in a newly efficient manner.  We understand that there are only so many hours in a day, and in this fast-paced industry it is nearly impossible to be informed and displayed of an opportunity exactly when it arises. Whether you are a Venue Manager looking for staff, or a Staff Candidate looking for part or full-time work, Shiftor allows you to promote your profile to hundreds of individuals and find your next opportunity.

    Weâ€™ve created a straightforward filter system that allows managers to quickly find the most qualified candidates for what they need. By simply creating a profile, job seekers are added to our Candidate List where they can be searched by tons of bars and restaurants throughout Manhattan! Creating a Shiftor account as a Staff Candidate is completely free, and once you fill out your information your profile will be posted to all Venue Managers.  Our online Candidate List allows Managers to search through hundreds of potential Staff Candidates with the touch of a button!
